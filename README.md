# ZAC - Zombie Apocalypse Computer
ZAC is an open-source, self-contained survival computer designed to operate completely off-grid. Built around a Raspberry Pi 5, it combines a local AI assistant, mesh radio communication, software-defined radio, offline knowledge libraries, and GPS navigation into a single ruggedized Pelican case. No internet required. No cloud. No subscriptions. Just you and a machine designed to work even if the rest of the world isn't.

At its heart is ZAC Shell, a unified interface that ties everything together. Unlike other off-grid computers that dump you into a Linux desktop with a dozen disconnected apps, ZAC presents a single, cohesive experience. Ask questions and get answers from a local LLM. Search Wikipedia, survival guides, and medical references instantly. Communicate with other ZAC units miles away via LoRa mesh. Scan radio frequencies for aircraft, weather satellites, and emergency broadcasts. Check your position on offline maps. All from one interface, designed to be usable by anyone, not just hackers (though it is fully open source and hackable!). 

ZAC isn't just a collection of DIY tools. It's a survival partner for you and your loved ones.
